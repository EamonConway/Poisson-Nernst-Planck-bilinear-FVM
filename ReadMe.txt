%% Mixed Poisson-Nernst-Planck

The numerical scheme presented here obtains a numerical solution to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations on an unstructured grid in cylindrical coordinates. The test problem used as an example in this work considers the flow of electrolyte between two ideally polarised electrodes.Therefore, the boundary conditions used in the simulations considered are no flux conditions on each ionic species and a constant potential difference the electrodes located at r=0 and r=L. 

It is hoped that this code can be used by other researchers to fully investigate ionic transport through a nanopore. 

Full documentation of this code is still in development.
